# Refactoring "Green Stocks" Analysis Code Using VBA
## Project Overview 
An analysis on a group of "Green" stocks was performed using code in VBA. The code worked on a group of 12 stocks, but what would happen if huundreds of stocks were added to the data you wanted to analyze? Though your code may work, there could be a make your code run faster when it comes to running analysis on more data. Below is a comparison of run times of original code and refactored code for data from two different years and a summary of the changes made to speed up time of the code.
